## What We're Testing

Please provide feedback on:

### Usability
- Was anything confusing?
- Were any fields unclear?
- Did the offline mode work correctly?
- How long did it take to log one observation?

### Data Fields
- Did you skip any fields? Which ones?
- Were any species missing from the dropdown?
- What additional information would be helpful to collect?

### Workflow
- Did the two-phase approach (quick field + detailed later) work well?
- Would you prefer to enter everything at once?
- Any features that would make it easier?
